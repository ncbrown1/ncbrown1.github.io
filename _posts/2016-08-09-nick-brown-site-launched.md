After multiple attempts of creating a personal website, I have finally followed through. My previous attempts were way too complicated and made it hard to be productive and proactive. I tried making a single-page application (SPA) with React and Redux, but it was too hard to make changes and I didn't make smart decisions with deployment. I also tried making a full stack Flask/Jinja website, but again, deployment troubles kept me from making progress.

Now, it is _very_ easy to work with my website. It's hosted completely by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), so I don't have to worry about deployments or overly complicated JavaScript frameworks. All I have to do is write, because it's Markdown! Jekyll is super easy to use and manage, so I can make rapid changes with little-to-no friction. I look forward to writing more and publishing content. Check back frequently!
