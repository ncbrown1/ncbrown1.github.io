  This application is being developed in order to illuminate the lack of a central information source for the University of California, Santa Barbara. It is made to scrape various campus-hosted websites for data describing current events or news, and use that data to display and link to the resource sources in a convenient interface for user digestion. Throughout the project, I have worked closely with college marketing/engineering teams in order to provide a similar experience to the products they are developing.
