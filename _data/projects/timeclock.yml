  Created a website to facilitate productive communication between employees and supervisors. Coded using the Django python library, as well as utilizing Javascript and CSS to make the user experience more fluid. Includes a clock-in/clock-out feature, shift history, timecard generation, staff forum, supervisor panel to show who is "clocked in", account management, and security features such as password encryption and an HTTPS connection.
