			<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After multiple attempts of creating a personal website, I have finally followed through. My previous attempts were way too complicated and made it hard to be productive and proactive. I tried making a single-page application (SPA) with React and Redux, but it was too hard to make changes and I didn’t make smart decisions with deployment. I also tried making a full stack Flask/Jinja website, but again, deployment troubles kept me from making progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; easy to work with my website. It’s hosted completely by &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; and powered by &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, so I don’t have to worry about deployments or overly complicated JavaScript frameworks. All I have to do is write, because it’s Markdown! Jekyll is super easy to use and manage, so I can make rapid changes with little-to-no friction. I look forward to writing more and publishing content. Check back frequently!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–Nick&lt;/p&gt;
