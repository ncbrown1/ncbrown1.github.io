    <h2 class="title is-3" id="my-blog">My Blog</h2>

    <p>This blog is the manifestation of the ongoings in my head that normally only get shared verbally with those that I interact with. I often find myself repeating the same stories, lessons, and ideas to many different people in a week, so perhaps it is time to start keeping track of it all in a way that is public for more than just my friends.</p>

    <p>What you read here will be a mix of material based on what is interesting to me at any given time. Most of the time, it will be programming or software-related, but it may venture out to different subjects, such as business, lifestyle, or even music. I have not blogged before, so please be patient as I develop my online voice.</p>

    <h2 class="title is-3" id="my-self">My Self</h2>

    <p>My first line of code was written a little over six years ago in my AP Computer Science class in high school: “hello world” in Java. It was a simple idea planted in my head, that I could just type some words in a text file and make the computer do what I wanted it to do. That idea took off and I just hung on for the ride. Hundreds of “hello world” programs later, I sit here about to start my career in the tech industry as a software developer.</p>

    <p>I am close to graduating from UC Santa Barbara with my Master’s degree in Computer Science, and my career is starting to unfold itself before my eyes. I do not know what the next few years have in store for me, but all I hope for is that I will be able to continue to learn and grow professionally so that I can continue to provide value to those around me. My latest endeavor has been Site Reliability Engineering at LinkedIn, where I am learning a great deal about product operations and site stability for massive scale cloud applications. It is an extremely rewarding experience, and it is my plan to continue with it.</p>

    <h2 class="title is-3" id="my-story">My Story</h2>

    <p>I was born and raised in Orange County, California, where I completed all of my K-12 schooling. My alma mater there is Valencia High School (class of 2013), where I participated in music, academic decathlon, student leadership, and ValTech (their tech program). Once I graduated from high school, I transitioned to college at UC Santa Barbara in Goleta, CA, where I studied Computer Science. I completed my Bachelor’s of Science in two and a half years, but was allowed to continue on into a Master’s program right away.</p>

    <p>When I am not coding, I really enjoy listening to and playing music. I am an avid saxophonist in the UCSB Jazz ensembles, which helps me exercise my creativity in a less engineer-minded way. Hopefully I will be able to continue with that past graduation. To a lesser extent, I enjoy playing guitar and ukelele, but it seems as though my skills at those instruments have deteriorated over time.</p>

    <p>Aside from music, my other passions include cooking/food, reading**, entrepreneurship, and fitness.</p>
