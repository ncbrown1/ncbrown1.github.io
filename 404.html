      <p>Once upon a midnight dreary,<br>
      While I surfed, weak and weary,<br>
      Over many a strange and spurious site of 'Dank Memes Galore'.<br>
      While I clicked my fav'rite bookmark,<br>
      Suddenly there came a warning,<br>
      And my heart was filled with mourning,<br>
      Mourning for my dear amour.<br><br></p>

      <p>'Tis not possible!, I pleaded,<br>
      But my browser, so conceited,<br>
      Remained blank, I then repeated,<br>
      Just a blank and nothing more.<br><br></p>

      <p>With a scream, I was defeated,<br>
      For my cookies were deleted,<br>
      So I begged, no longer seated,<br>
      Give me back my memes hardcore!<br><br></p>

      <p>Then, in answer to my query,<br>
      Through the net I loved so dearly,<br>
      Came its answer, dark and dreary:<br>
      Quoth the server, 404.</p>
