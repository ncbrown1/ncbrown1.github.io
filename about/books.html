    <p>Below are some of the books that I have read over my career that I suggest others read as well. In the sections below each title, I describe a bit about what the book is about and why I think it is a good book to read.</p>

    <h3 class="title">Soft Skills: The Software Developer’s Life Manual</h3>
    <h4 class="subtitle">by <i>John Sonmez</i></h4>

    <p>While yes, this book is targeted towards software developers, it is still definitely applicable to people in any industry. There are seven sections in total for this book: Your Career; Marketing Yourself; Learning; Productivity; Finance; Fitness; and Spirit. Each section gives a pretty good overview of the topic, with references to materials that you can use to go more in-depth. Even though John Sonmez might not be the subject area master of any of these subjects, he does have good ideas and examples that help you identify the core points. And being able to have all of these in one book is very convenient and useful.</p>

    <p>I found this book a good introduction to becoming a better all-around person. If you don’t really think of yourself of a “reader” (as I did), get this on Audible or try to power through it. I promise you that it will motivate you to read even more and move faster jumpstart your professional career.</p>

    <h3 class="title">The Start-Up of You</h3>
    <h4 class="subtitle">by <i>Reid Hoffman</i> and <i>Ben Casnocha</i></h4>

    <p>The modern professional world is much, much different from what it was a generation or two ago. People don’t have lifelong careers at single companies any more; most people do go to college, as a most jobs require a degree; when they do get jobs, they usually only stay for two or three years and then move on to the next opportunity. In his book, “The Start-Up of You”, Reid Hoffman goes into depth about how to deal with the modern twist of professionalism.</p>

    <p>Essentially, we are all born as entrepreneurs, whether we know it or not. Reid and Ben describe how to treat your life as if it were a startup and you were the CEO, where you must take into account many of the things that typical CEOs do. Things such as: risk analysis, networks, competitive advantage, and adaptive planning. The book is really easy to get through, and the concepts are powerful and life-changing.</p>

    <h3 class="title">How to Win Friends and Influence People</h3>
    <h4 class="subtitle">by <i>Dale Carnegie</i></h4>

    <p>I am currently in the middle of reading this book. I will let you know how it turns out once I get a bit further.</p>
